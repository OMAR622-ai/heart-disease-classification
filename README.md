This project aims to classify patients who have suffered a heart attack using machine learning. The classification is binary, meaning the model predicts one of two possible outcomes: whether a patient has had a heart attack or not.

Algorithms Used
Several machine learning algorithms were tested:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Classifies patients based on similarity to nearby data points.
Logistic Regression: A statistical method that predicts probabilities for binary outcomes.
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Finds the optimal boundary to separate classes.
Best Performance
The highest accuracy achieved was 95%, obtained using Random Forest. This high accuracy is due to ensemble learning, where multiple decision trees work together to make predictions. Ensemble learning improves generalization, reduces overfitting, and enhances model stability.
